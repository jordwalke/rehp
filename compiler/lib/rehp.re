/*
 * Rehp: A constrained intermediate language to model various language
 * backends.
 *
 * Rehp has semantics similar to a very narrow subset of JavaScript, with the
 * addition of special nodes that track types, externs, and different shapes of
 * structures emitted by the ocaml compiler.
 *
 * Currently, Rehp contains too many possible forms, because there is a
 * conversion step from JavaScript to Rehp that occurs so that the js_of_ocaml
 * compiler can analyze hand written JavaScript.
 *
 * This project aims to remove that architecture of js_of_ocaml, so that
 * js_of_ocaml treats hand written JavaScript as raw strings, without ever
 * doing any analysis on it. The benefit is that we can then remove many parts
 * of Rehp, simplify it, and it will therefore be even easier to support
 * multiple language backends.
 *
 * We should also formalize the semantics of Rehp, as well as specify the
 * constraints:
 * - How should variable scoping work.
 * - Function arity.
 * - And more.
